# GARCH-Model
GARCH(1,1) model for volatility analysis with a Monte Carlo simulation of possible returns using the conditional volatility derived from this model. The relevance of the GARCH model and the simulation are evaluated in terms of RMSE.

This code requires including the Eigen library.

You are free to analyze the volatility of any financial asset that has returns. You just need to provide a CSV file containing the closing prices of the financial asset.

The included CSV file represents the data for ETH/BUSD, perpetual futures contracts, with a 1-minute interval, covering the period from June 30, 2023, to July 6, 2023.
